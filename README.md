# IS436-Project---Connect-Care-CC-

Goal:
The purpose of our website is to create a web platform that can help doctors and patients easily access any health related data. 
The design of the website is to help patients securely access their medical records, view any medical bills the individual owes, manage their medical appointments, and communicate with doctors without having to go in person to the doctorâ€™s office to do so. 
Our main objectives are to provide a website that will provide a secure interface for patients, doctors, and administrators, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability, and ease of use, all in accordance with HIPAA and other government regulations.

Technologies:
We used Javascript, CSS, and SQL to make sure our webpage and servers are up and running. 
We hope that our website can provide a modern look while also providing the functionality that we mentioned in our goal.
With SQL, we will store all the information necessary, making sure that good security protocols are put in place to align with HIPAA.
We hope to achieve this through the use of different tables and tags that can help us do so.
