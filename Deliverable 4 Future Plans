Our future plans after Deliverable 4 is to implement the SQL scripts that we have written and assign them to the appropriate people.
Those people would be the ones in charge of backend development which is Ali and Michael who are the backend developer and database administrator.
On the front-end side, we will work towards getting out website out, although it may not be the finished product, we would still like to have some functionality going with it
like a working login page for all the users, doctors, and admins. This login page should lead to different dashboards based off of who the user is, with doctors, users, and
admins should all have different functionalities. This will be assigned to the front-end developers. Before all of this, however, we plan on having a map and a wireframe diagram
to have a better understanding of what we need to do.
